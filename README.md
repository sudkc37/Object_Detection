# Beyond the Surface: Intelligent Object Recognition and Text Retrieval

Abstract:

This project presents an intelligent system that combines object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for real-time vehicle license plate recognition. Leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model, the system accurately identifies vehicles and isolates their license plates. OCR is subsequently employed to extract alphanumeric characters from the detected plates, enabling seamless text retrieval. By integrating advanced computer vision techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system ensures high accuracy and robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. This solution has significant applications in automated toll systems, traffic monitoring, and parking management, offering a scalable approach to efficient and reliable license plate recognition.
