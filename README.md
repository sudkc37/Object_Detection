Beyond the Surface: Intelligent Object Recognition and Text Retrieval

Overview:
This project involves developing a system capable of detecting objects of interest using a pre-trained model and utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text retrieval. The primary use case is to integrate computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a robust solution that retrieves vehicle license plate numbers in real time. This innovative approach combines advanced technologies to ensure accurate and efficient performance in real-world scenarios.
