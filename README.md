# Beyond the Surface: Intelligent Object Recognition and Text Retrieval

**Abstract:**

This project presents an intelligent system that combines object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for real-time vehicle license plate recognition. Leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model, the system accurately identifies vehicles and isolates their license plates. OCR is subsequently employed to extract alphanumeric characters from the detected plates, enabling seamless text retrieval. By integrating advanced computer vision techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the system ensures high accuracy and robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. This solution has significant applications in automated toll systems, traffic monitoring, and parking management, offering a scalable approach to efficient and reliable license plate recognition.

**Introduction**

The rapid advancements in computer vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have paved the way for automated systems in various industries, with vehicle license plate recognition emerging as a key application in traffic monitoring, toll collection, and parking management. However, existing solutions often face challenges such as low accuracy under varying environmental conditions, real-time processing constraints, and the complexity of integrating object detection with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This project aims to address these issues by developing a robust and efficient system for real-time license plate recognition. Leveraging pre-trained models, specifically facebook/detr-resnet-50, the system was fine-tuned using labeled data from RoboFlow to detect vehicles and isolate license plates accurately. The data pipeline was built using Supervision, PyTorch-Lightning, and Transformers, ensuring seamless preprocessing, augmentation, and model retraining. OCR capabilities, powered by Tesseract, were integrated to extract alphanumeric characters from detected plates. The entire solution, incorporating image preprocessing with OpenCV, is deployed using Flask for real-time predictions and Docker for environment compatibility. This project strives to enhance the operational efficiency of automated vehicle systems while ensuring scalability and accuracy in real-world environments.
